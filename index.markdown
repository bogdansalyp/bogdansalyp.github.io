I'm Bogdan.

Previously, I've been a Founding AI Engineer @ [ReText.AI](https://retext.ai) and [MobGuards](https://mobguards.com) and Cisco ML Researcher under [Landon Curt Noll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Curt_Noll) supervision.

I am AI lecturer, mentor and speaker. Recently, I've open-sourced my Machine Learning course to YouTube. I've been teaching it since 2016 at BMSTU, where I got my Masters and Bachelors.

I'm the member of [IAHD](https://iahd.cc) and aspire to become the [Eleuther.AI](https://www.eleuther.ai) researcher.
